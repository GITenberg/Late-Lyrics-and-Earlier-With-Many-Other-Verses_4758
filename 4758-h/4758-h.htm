<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>APOLOGY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> half the verses that follow
were written quite lately.&nbsp; The rest are older, having been
held over in MS. when past volumes were published, on considering
that these would contain a sufficient number of pages to offer
readers at one time, more especially during the distractions of
the war.&nbsp; The unusually far back poems to be found here are,
however, but some that were overlooked in gathering previous
collections.&nbsp; A freshness in them, now unattainable, seemed
to make up for their inexperience and to justify their
inclusion.&nbsp; A few are dated; the dates of others are not
discoverable.</p>
<p>The launching of a volume of this kind in neo-Georgian days by
one who began writing in mid-Victorian, and has published nothing
to speak of for some years, may seem to call for a few words of
excuse or <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>explanation.&nbsp; Whether or no, readers may feel
assured that a new book is submitted to them with great
hesitation at so belated a date.&nbsp; Insistent practical
reasons, however, among which were requests from some illustrious
men of letters who are in sympathy with my productions, the
accident that several of the poems have already seen the light,
and that dozens of them have been lying about for years,
compelled the course adopted, in spite of the natural
disinclination of a writer whose works have been so frequently
regarded askance by a pragmatic section here and there, to draw
attention to them once more.</p>
<p>I do not know that it is necessary to say much on the contents
of the book, even in deference to suggestions that will be
mentioned presently.&nbsp; I believe that those readers who care
for my poems at all&mdash;readers to whom no passport is
required&mdash;will care for this new instalment of them, perhaps
the last, as much as for any that have preceded them.&nbsp;
Moreover, in the eyes of a less friendly class the pieces, though
a very mixed collection indeed, contain, so far as I am able to
see, little or nothing in technic or teaching that can be
considered a Star-Chamber matter, or so much as agitating to a
ladies&rsquo; <a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>school; even though, to use Wordsworth&rsquo;s
observation in his Preface to <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, such
readers may suppose &ldquo;that by the act of writing in verse an
author makes a formal engagement that he will gratify certain
known habits of association: that he not only thus apprises the
reader that certain classes of ideas and expressions will be
found in his book, but that others will be carefully
excluded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true, nevertheless, that some grave, positive, stark,
delineations are interspersed among those of the passive,
lighter, and traditional sort presumably nearer to stereotyped
tastes.&nbsp; For&mdash;while I am quite aware that a thinker is
not expected, and, indeed, is scarcely allowed, now more than
heretofore, to state all that crosses his mind concerning
existence in this universe, in his attempts to explain or excuse
the presence of evil and the incongruity of penalizing the
irresponsible&mdash;it must be obvious to open intelligences
that, without denying the beauty and faithful service of certain
venerable cults, such disallowance of &ldquo;obstinate
questionings&rdquo; and &ldquo;blank misgivings&rdquo; tends to a
paralysed intellectual stalemate.&nbsp; Heine observed nearly a
hundred years ago that the soul has her eternal rights; that she
will not be darkened <a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>by statutes, nor lullabied by the
music of bells.&nbsp; And what is to-day, in allusions to the
present author&rsquo;s pages, alleged to be
&ldquo;pessimism&rdquo; is, in truth, only such
&ldquo;questionings&rdquo; in the exploration of reality, and is
the first step towards the soul&rsquo;s betterment, and the
body&rsquo;s also.</p>
<p>If I may be forgiven for quoting my own old words, let me
repeat what I printed in this relation more than twenty years
ago, and wrote much earlier, in a poem entitled &ldquo;In
Tenebris&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">If way to the Better
there be, it exacts a full look at the Worst:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that is to say, by the exploration of reality, and its frank
recognition stage by stage along the survey, with an eye to the
best consummation possible: briefly, evolutionary
meliorism.&nbsp; But it is called pessimism nevertheless; under
which word, expressed with condemnatory emphasis, it is regarded
by many as some pernicious new thing (though so old as to
underlie the Christian idea, and even to permeate the Greek
drama); and the subject is charitably left to decent silence, as
if further comment were needless.</p>
<p>Happily there are some who feel such Levitical passing-by to
be, alas, by no <a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>means a permanent dismissal of the matter; that comment
on where the world stands is very much the reverse of needless in
these disordered years of our prematurely afflicted century: that
amendment and not madness lies that way.&nbsp; And looking down
the future these few hold fast to the same: that whether the
human and kindred animal races survive till the exhaustion or
destruction of the globe, or whether these races perish and are
succeeded by others before that conclusion comes, pain to all
upon it, tongued or dumb, shall be kept down to a minimum by
lovingkindness, operating through scientific knowledge, and
actuated by the modicum of free will conjecturally possessed by
organic life when the mighty necessitating
forces&mdash;unconscious or other&mdash;that have &ldquo;the
balancings of the clouds,&rdquo; happen to be in equilibrium,
which may or may not be often.</p>
<p>To conclude this question I may add that the argument of the
so-called optimists is neatly summarized in a stern pronouncement
against me by my friend Mr. Frederic Harrison in a late essay of
his, in the words: &ldquo;This view of life is not
mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; The solemn declaration does not seem to me to
be so annihilating to <a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>the said &ldquo;view&rdquo; (really a
series of fugitive impressions which I have never tried to
co-ordinate) as is complacently assumed.&nbsp; Surely it embodies
a too human fallacy quite familiar in logic.&nbsp; Next, a
knowing reviewer, apparently a Roman Catholic young man, speaks,
with some rather gross instances of the <i>suggestio falsi</i> in
his article, of &ldquo;Mr. Hardy refusing consolation,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;dark gravity of his ideas,&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; When a
Positivist and a Catholic agree there must be something wonderful
in it, which should make a poet sit up.&nbsp; But . . . O that
&rsquo;twere possible!</p>
<p>I would not have alluded in this place or anywhere else to
such casual personal criticisms&mdash;for casual and unreflecting
they must be&mdash;but for the satisfaction of two or three
friends in whose opinion a short answer was deemed desirable, on
account of the continual repetition of these criticisms, or more
precisely, quizzings.&nbsp; After all, the serious and truly
literary inquiry in this connection is: Should a shaper of such
stuff as dreams are made on disregard considerations of what is
customary and expected, and apply himself to the real function of
poetry, the application of ideas to life (in Matthew
Arnold&rsquo;s familiar phrase)?&nbsp; <a name="pagexi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xi</span>This bears more particularly on what
has been called the &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; of these
poems&mdash;usually reproved as &ldquo;queer.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whoever the author may be that undertakes such application of
ideas in this &ldquo;philosophic&rdquo; direction&mdash;where it
is specially required&mdash;glacial judgments must inevitably
fall upon him amid opinion whose arbiters largely decry
individuality, to whom <i>ideas</i> are oddities to smile at, who
are moved by a yearning the reverse of that of the Athenian
inquirers on Mars Hill; and stiffen their features not only at
sound of a new thing, but at a restatement of old things in new
terms.&nbsp; Hence should anything of this sort in the following
adumbrations seem &ldquo;queer&rdquo;&mdash;should any of them
seem to good Panglossians to embody strange and disrespectful
conceptions of this best of all possible worlds, I apologize; but
cannot help it.</p>
<p>Such divergences, which, though piquant for the nonce, it
would be affectation to say are not saddening and discouraging
likewise, may, to be sure, arise sometimes from superficial
aspect only, writer and reader seeing the same thing at different
angles.&nbsp; But in palpable cases of divergence they arise, as
already said, <a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>whenever a serious effort is made towards that which
the authority I have cited&mdash;who would now be called
old-fashioned, possibly even parochial&mdash;affirmed to be what
no good critic could deny as the poet&rsquo;s province, the
application of ideas to life.&nbsp; One might shrewdly guess, by
the by, that in such recommendation the famous writer may have
overlooked the cold-shouldering results upon an enthusiastic
disciple that would be pretty certain to follow his putting the
high aim in practice, and have forgotten the disconcerting
experience of Gil Blas with the Archbishop.</p>
<p>To add a few more words to what has already taken up too many,
there is a contingency liable to miscellanies of verse that I
have never seen mentioned, so far as I can remember; I mean the
chance little shocks that may be caused over a book of various
character like the present and its predecessors by the
juxtaposition of unrelated, even discordant, effusions; poems
perhaps years apart in the making, yet facing each other.&nbsp;
An odd result of this has been that dramatic anecdotes of a
satirical and humorous intention (such, <i>e.g.</i>, as
&ldquo;Royal Sponsors&rdquo;) following verse in graver voice,
have been read as misfires <a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>because they raise the smile that
they were intended to raise, the journalist, deaf to the sudden
change of key, being unconscious that he is laughing with the
author and not at him.&nbsp; I admit that I did not foresee such
contingencies as I ought to have done, and that people might not
perceive when the tone altered.&nbsp; But the difficulties of
arranging the themes in a graduated kinship of moods would have
been so great that irrelation was almost unavoidable with efforts
so diverse.&nbsp; I must trust for right note-catching to those
finely-touched spirits who can divine without half a whisper,
whose intuitiveness is proof against all the accidents of
inconsequence.&nbsp; In respect of the less alert, however,
should any one&rsquo;s train of thought be thrown out of gear by
a consecutive piping of vocal reeds in jarring tonics, without a
semiquaver&rsquo;s rest between, and be led thereby to miss the
writer&rsquo;s aim and meaning in one out of two contiguous
compositions, I shall deeply regret it.</p>
<p>Having at last, I think, finished with the personal points
that I was recommended to notice, I will forsake the immediate
object of this Preface; and, leaving <i>Late Lyrics</i> to
whatever fate it deserves, <a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>digress for a few moments to more
general considerations.&nbsp; The thoughts of any man of letters
concerned to keep poetry alive cannot but run uncomfortably on
the precarious prospects of English verse at the present
day.&nbsp; Verily the hazards and casualties surrounding the
birth and setting forth of almost every modern creation in
numbers are ominously like those of one of Shelley&rsquo;s
paper-boats on a windy lake.&nbsp; And a forward conjecture
scarcely permits the hope of a better time, unless men&rsquo;s
tendencies should change.&nbsp; So indeed of all art, literature,
and &ldquo;high thinking&rdquo; nowadays.&nbsp; Whether owing to
the barbarizing of taste in the younger minds by the dark madness
of the late war, the unabashed cultivation of selfishness in all
classes, the plethoric growth of knowledge simultaneously with
the stunting of wisdom, &ldquo;a degrading thirst after
outrageous stimulation&rdquo; (to quote Wordsworth again), or
from any other cause, we seem threatened with a new Dark Age.</p>
<p>I formerly thought, like so many roughly handled writers, that
so far as literature was concerned a partial cause might be
impotent or mischievous criticism; the satirizing of
individuality, the lack of whole-seeing in contemporary estimates
<a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>of poetry
and kindred work, the knowingness affected by junior reviewers,
the overgrowth of meticulousness in their peerings for an
opinion, as if it were a cultivated habit in them to scrutinize
the tool-marks and be blind to the building, to hearken for the
key-creaks and be deaf to the diapason, to judge the landscape by
a nocturnal exploration with a flash-lantern.&nbsp; In other
words, to carry on the old game of sampling the poem or drama by
quoting the worst line or worst passage only, in ignorance or not
of Coleridge&rsquo;s proof that a versification of any length
neither can be nor ought to be all poetry; of reading meanings
into a book that its author never dreamt of writing there.&nbsp;
I might go on interminably.</p>
<p>But I do not now think any such temporary obstructions to be
the cause of the hazard, for these negligences and ignorances,
though they may have stifled a few true poets in the run of
generations, disperse like stricken leaves before the wind of
next week, and are no more heard of again in the region of
letters than their writers themselves.&nbsp; No: we may be
convinced that something of the deeper sort mentioned must be the
cause.</p>
<p><a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>In
any event poetry, pure literature in general, religion&mdash;I
include religion because poetry and religion touch each other, or
rather modulate into each other; are, indeed, often but different
names for the same thing&mdash;these, I say, the visible signs of
mental and emotional life, must like all other things keep
moving, becoming; even though at present, when belief in witches
of Endor is displacing the Darwinian theory and &ldquo;the truth
that shall make you free,&rdquo; men&rsquo;s minds appear, as
above noted, to be moving backwards rather than on.&nbsp; I
speak, of course, somewhat sweepingly, and should except many
isolated minds; also the minds of men in certain worthy but small
bodies of various denominations, and perhaps in the homely
quarter where advance might have been the very least expected a
few years back&mdash;the English Church&mdash;if one reads it
rightly as showing evidence of &ldquo;removing those things that
are shaken,&rdquo; in accordance with the wise Epistolary
recommendation to the Hebrews.&nbsp; For since the historic and
once august hierarchy of Rome some generation ago lost its chance
of being the religion of the future by doing otherwise, and
throwing over the little band of neo-Catholics who were making a
struggle for continuity by <a name="pagexvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>applying the principle of evolution
to their own faith, joining hands with modern science, and
outflanking the hesitating English instinct towards liturgical
reform (a flank march which I at the time quite expected to
witness, with the gathering of many millions of waiting agnostics
into its fold); since then, one may ask, what other purely
English establishment than the Church, of sufficient dignity and
footing, and with such strength of old association, such
architectural spell, is left in this country to keep the shreds
of morality together?</p>
<p>It may be a forlorn hope, a mere dream, that of an alliance
between religion, which must be retained unless the world is to
perish, and complete rationality, which must come, unless also
the world is to perish, by means of the interfusing effect of
poetry&mdash;&ldquo;the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge;
the impassioned expression of science,&rdquo; as it was defined
by an English poet who was quite orthodox in his ideas.&nbsp; But
if it be true, as Comte argued, that advance is never in a
straight line, but in a looped orbit, we may, in the aforesaid
ominous moving backward, be doing it <i>pour mieux sauter</i>,
drawing back for a spring.&nbsp; <a name="pagexviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>I repeat that I forlornly hope so,
notwithstanding the supercilious regard of hope by Schopenhauer,
von Hartmann, and other philosophers down to Einstein who have my
respect.&nbsp; But one dares not prophesy.&nbsp; Physical,
chronological, and other contingencies keep me in these days from
critical studies and literary circles</p>
<blockquote><p>Where once we held debate, a band<br />
Of youthful friends, on mind and art</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(if one may quote Tennyson in this century of free
verse).&nbsp; Hence I cannot know how things are going so well as
I used to know them, and the aforesaid limitations must quite
prevent my knowing hence-forward.</p>
<p>I have to thank the editors and owners of <i>The Times</i>,
<i>Fortnightly</i>, <i>Mercury</i>, and other periodicals in
which a few of the poems have appeared for kindly assenting to
their being reclaimed for collected publication.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Hippolite Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon,
first-fiddler at Vauxhall Gardens, composed what was probably the

Bishop Ken&rsquo;s words, but is now seldom heard.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">He</span> said:
&ldquo;Awake my soul, and with the sun,&rdquo; . . .<br />

The irradiate globe that vouched the dark as done.</p>
<p class="poetry">It lit his face&mdash;the weary face of one<br

Who in the adjacent gardens charged his string,<br />
Nightly, with many a tuneful tender thing, <br />
Till stars were weak, and dancing hours outrun.</p>

In trial tones as he pursued his way:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in my heart,<br />
Said: &ldquo;God your guardian kept our fleeting<br />

Sighing and drawing her furs around her <br />
Over the shroud that tightly bound her,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Of his life&rsquo;s one day of dreamery.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman came into his room<br

Between the dawn and the creeping day:<br />
She was the years-wed wife from whom<br />
He had parted, and who lived far away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if strangers they.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wondered, and as she
stood<br />
She put on youth in her look and air,<br />
And more was he wonderstruck as he viewed<br />
Her form and flesh bloom yet more fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While he watched her there;</p>

&ldquo;Stay&mdash;rest!&mdash;&rdquo;<br />

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clothed, and drew

But she was not in the house, he found;<br />

Of the avenue elms, and searched around<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the park-pale bound.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mounted, and rode till
night<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Had</span> I but lived a

I might have gone, as I have gone this year,<br />
By Warmwell Cross on to a Cove I know,<br />
And Time have placed his finger on me there:</p>

might have looked, and said,<br />
&ldquo;O yes: I see him.&nbsp; One that boat has brought<br />

Rome, landed one day on the Dorset coast, and composed the

Lulworth Cove.</p>

Eve, in the street alone,<br />
Outside a house, on the pavement-stone,<br />
I sang to her, as we&rsquo;d sung together<br />
On former eves ere I felt her tether.&mdash;<br />
Above the door of green by me<br />
Was she, her casement seen by me;<br />

Baptisms, burials, doctorings, conjugal counsel&mdash;<br />

Yet under all concealing a precious art-feat.<br />
Such I had found not yet.&nbsp; My latest capture<br />
Came from the rooms of a trader in ancient house-gear<br />
Who had no scent of beauty or soul for brushcraft.<br />
Only a tittle cost it&mdash;murked with grime-films,<br />
Gatherings of slow years, thick-varnished over,<br />
Never a feature manifest of man&rsquo;s painting.</p>

ticking hard on midnight<br />
Ere an hour subserved, I set me upon it.<br />

Then another, like fair flesh, and another;<br />

nay, Italian!&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;Then meseemed it the guise of the ranker Venus,<br />
Named of some Astarte, of some Cotytto.<br />
Down I knelt before it and kissed the panel,<br />
Drunk with the lure of love&rsquo;s inhibited dreamings.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the dawn I rubbed, when
there gazed up at me<br />
A hag, that had slowly emerged from under my hands there,<br />
Pointing the slanted finger towards a bosom<br />
Eaten away of a rot from the lusts of a lifetime . . .<br />
&mdash;I could have ended myself in heart-shook horror.<br />
Stunned I sat till roused by a clear-voiced bell-chime,<br />
Fresh and sweet as the dew-fleece under my luthern.<br />

CHAPEL-ORGANIST<br />
(<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 185&ndash;)</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">I&rsquo;ve</span> been
thinking it through, as I play here to-night, to play never
again,<br />
By the light of that lowering sun peering in at the
window-pane,<br />
And over the back-street roofs, throwing shades from the boys of
the chore<br />
In the gallery, right upon me, sitting up to these keys once more
. . .</p>
<p class="poetry">How I used to hear tongues ask, as I sat here
when I was new:<br />
&ldquo;Who is she playing the organ?&nbsp; She touches it
mightily true!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;She travels from Havenpool Town,&rdquo; the deacon would
softly speak,<br />
&ldquo;The stipend can hardly cover her fare hither twice in the
week.&rdquo;<br />
<a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>(It fell
far short of doing, indeed; but I never told,<br />
For I have craved minstrelsy more than lovers, or beauty, or
gold.)</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twas so he answered at first, but the
story grew different later:<br />
&ldquo;It cannot go on much longer, from what we hear of her
now!&rdquo;<br />
At the meaning wheeze in the words the inquirer would shift his
place<br />
Till he could see round the curtain that screened me from people
below.<br />
&ldquo;A handsome girl,&rdquo; he would murmur, upstaring, (and
so I am).<br />
&ldquo;But&mdash;too much sex in her build; fine eyes, but
eyelids too heavy;<br />
A bosom too full for her age; in her lips too voluptuous a
look.&rdquo;<br />
(It may be.&nbsp; But who put it there?&nbsp; Assuredly it was
not I.)</p>
<p class="poetry">I went on playing and singing when this I had
heard, and more,<br />
Though tears half-blinded me; yes, I remained going on and on,<br
/>
Just as I used me to chord and to sing at the selfsame time! . .
.<br />
For it&rsquo;s a contralto&mdash;my voice is; they&rsquo;ll hear
it again here to-night<br />
<a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>In the
psalmody notes that I love more than world or than flesh or than
life.</p>
<p class="poetry">Well, the deacon, in fact, that day had learnt
new tidings about me;<br />
They troubled his mind not a little, for he was a worthy man.<br
/>
(He trades as a chemist in High Street, and during the week he
had sought<br />
His fellow-deacon, who throve as a book-binder over the way.)<br
/>
&ldquo;These are strange rumours,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
must guard the good name of the chapel.<br />
If, sooth, she&rsquo;s of evil report, what else can we do but
dismiss her?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;&mdash;But get such another to play here we cannot for
double the price!&rdquo;<br />
It settled the point for the time, and I triumphed awhile in
their strait,<br />
And my much-beloved grand semibreves went living on under my
fingers.</p>
<p class="poetry">At length in the congregation more head-shakes
and murmurs were rife,<br />
And my dismissal was ruled, though I was not warned of it
then.<br />
But a day came when they declared it.&nbsp; The news entered me
as a sword;<br />
<a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>I was
broken; so pallid of face that they thought I should faint, they
said.<br />
I rallied.&nbsp; &ldquo;O, rather than go, I will play you for
nothing!&rdquo; said I.<br />
&rsquo;Twas in much desperation I spoke it, for bring me to
forfeit I could not<br />
Those melodies chorded so richly for which I had laboured and
lived.<br />
They paused.&nbsp; And for nothing I played at the chapel through
Sundays anon,<br />
Upheld by that art which I loved more than blandishments lavished
of men.</p>
<p class="poetry">But it fell that murmurs again from the flock
broke the pastor&rsquo;s peace.<br />
Some member had seen me at Havenpool, comrading close a
sea-captain.<br />
(Yes; I was thereto constrained, lacking means for the fare to
and fro.)<br />
Yet God knows, if aught He knows ever, I loved the Old-Hundredth,
Saint Stephen&rsquo;s,<br />
Mount Zion, New Sabbath, Miles-Lane, Holy Rest, and Arabia, and
Eaton,<br />
Above all embraces of body by wooers who sought me and won! . .
.<br />
Next week &rsquo;twas declared I was seen coming home with a
lover at dawn.<br />
<a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>The
deacons insisted then, strong; and forgiveness I did not
implore.<br />
I saw all was lost for me, quite, but I made a last bid in my
throbs.<br />
High love had been beaten by lust; and the senses had conquered
the soul,<br />
But the soul should die game, if I knew it!&nbsp; I turned to my
masters and said:<br />
&ldquo;I yield, Gentlemen, without parlance.&nbsp; But&mdash;let
me just hymn you <i>once</i> more!<br />
It&rsquo;s a little thing, Sirs, that I ask; and a passion is
music with me!&rdquo;<br />
They saw that consent would cost nothing, and show as good grace,
as knew I,<br />
Though tremble I did, and feel sick, as I paused thereat, dumb
for their words.<br />
They gloomily nodded assent, saying, &ldquo;Yes, if you care
to.&nbsp; Once more,<br />
And only once more, understand.&rdquo;&nbsp; To that with a bend
I agreed.<br />
&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a fixed and a far-reaching
look,&rdquo; spoke one who had eyed me awhile.<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a fixed and a far-reaching plan, and my look
only showed it,&rdquo; said I.</p>

155</span>&ldquo;She plays as if she were possessed!&rdquo; they
exclaim, glancing upward and round.<br />
&ldquo;Such harmonies I never dreamt the old instrument capable
of!&rdquo;<br />
Meantime the sun lowers and goes; shades deepen; the lights are
turned up,<br />
And the people voice out the last singing: tune Tallis: the
Evening Hymn.<br />
(I wonder Dissenters sing Ken: it shows them more liberal in
spirit<br />
At this little chapel down here than at certain new others I
know.)<br />
I sing as I play.&nbsp; Murmurs some one: &ldquo;No woman&rsquo;s
throat richer than hers!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;True: in these parts, at least,&rdquo; ponder I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But, my man, you will hear it no more.&rdquo;<br />
And I sing with them onward: &ldquo;The grave dread as little do
I as my bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">I lift up my feet from the pedals; and then,
while my eyes are still wet<br />
From the symphonies born of my fingers, I do that whereon I am
set,<br />
And draw from my &ldquo;full round bosom,&rdquo; (their words;
how can <i>I</i> help its heave?)<br />
<a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>A bottle
blue-coloured and fluted&mdash;a vinaigrette, they may
conceive&mdash;<br />
And before the choir measures my meaning, reads aught in my moves
to and fro,<br />
I drink from the phial at a draught, and they think it a
pick-me-up; so.<br />
Then I gather my books as to leave, bend over the keys as to
pray.<br />
When they come to me motionless, stooping, quick death will have
whisked me away.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Sure, nobody meant her to poison herself
in her haste, after all!&rdquo;<br />
The deacons will say as they carry me down and the night shadows
fall,<br />
&ldquo;Though the charges were true,&rdquo; they will add.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a case red as scarlet withal!&rdquo;<br />
I have never once minced it.&nbsp; Lived chaste I have not.&nbsp;
Heaven knows it above! . . .<br />
But past all the heavings of passion&mdash;it&rsquo;s music has
been my life-love! . . .<br />
That tune did go well&mdash;this last playing! . . . I reckon
they&rsquo;ll bury me here . . .<br />
Not a soul from the seaport my birthplace&mdash;will come, or
bestow me . . . a tear.</p>

You bade me pluck the flower<br />
Within the other woman&rsquo;s bower,<br />

<p class="poetry">I thought the flower blushed
deeplier&mdash;aye,<br />

It seemed to breathe: &ldquo;I am, I see,<br />
Made use of in a human play.&rdquo;</p>

As phantom from the pane thereby<br />
A corpse-like countenance, with eye<br />

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The church!&rdquo; they whispered with
qualms; &ldquo;where often she sits.&rdquo;<br />
They found her: facing the brass there, else seeing none,<br />
But feeling the words with her finger, gibbering in fits;<br />

<p class="poetry">And so she remained, in her handmaids&rsquo;

Tracing words in the air with her finger, as seen that
night&mdash;<br />
<a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>Those
incised on the brass&mdash;till at length unwatched one noon,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; She vanished from sight.</p>
<p class="poetry">And, as talebearers tell, thence on to her
last-taken breath<br />
Was unseen, save as wraith that in front of the brass made
moan;<br />
So that ever the way of her life and the time of her death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Remained unknown.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
